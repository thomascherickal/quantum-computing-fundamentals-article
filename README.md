# Quantum Computing Fundamentals — Example Programs

Author: Thomas Cherickal  
Repository: quantum-computing-fundamentals-article  
Languages: Python, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

* This repository collects short, focused example programs (scripts and notebooks) that demonstrate fundamental concepts in quantum computing using Qiskit and Qiskit Aer.
* The examples are educational: they illustrate states, gates, basic algorithms (Grover, QFT, QPE, Shor), and important theoretical results (no-cloning).
* Each script builds a small circuit, often simulates it with Aer, and prints or visualizes results.
* Enjoy Quantum!
